libHierGA
===========
Sebastian Lenartowicz's Hierarchical Genetic Algorithms Library

This framework provides a basic library for basic and hierarchical genetic
algorithms. It is completely function-agnostic, and the only thing that it
needs to start running is a fitness function (or a set of them), and an
appropriately constructed GA.

WARNING: Compiling from source requires gcc 4.6.3 or later.

PLEASE NOTE: All examples are designed to be quite verbose while running, and
the output should be sent to a file for reading and interpretation. For
instance, the simplest example, 1max, outputs around 8,000 lines of text.
