Sebastian Lenartowicz's Genetic Algorithm Framework

This framework provides a basic library for basic and hierarchical genetic
algorithms. It is completely function-agnostic, and the only thing that it
needs to start running is a fitness function (or a set of them), and an
appropriately constructed GA.

WARNING: Compiling from source requires gcc 4.6.3 or later.
